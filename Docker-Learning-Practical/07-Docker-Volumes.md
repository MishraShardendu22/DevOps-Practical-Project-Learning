# Docker Volumes

## Overview

Docker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

## Volume Commands

### List Volumes

```bash
docker volume ls
```

### Inspect Volume

```bash
docker volume inspect <volume-name>
```

### Create Volume

```bash
docker volume create <volume-name>
```

## Volume Types

### Named Volume

A volume with a specific name that can be referenced across containers.

```bash
docker run -v <volume-name>:/path/in/container <image>
```

### Bind Mount (Path)

Mount a specific host directory into a container.

```bash
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path <image>
```

## Best Practices

- Use named volumes for data that needs to persist
- Use bind mounts for development when you need to share code
- Regularly backup important volume data
